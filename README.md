💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection – 99.77% Accuracy

A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world, highly imbalanced data.

🔍 Overview

Tackled class imbalance with SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

Trained and evaluated multiple models on balanced data

Focused on precision, recall, and F1-score to measure fraud detection performance
